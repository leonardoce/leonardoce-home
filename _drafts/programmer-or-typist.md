Are you a programmer, aren't you? So, as [we are typists first and programmers
second](http://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/),
you should know to touch type.

Nevertheless I know a bunch of programmers who don't touch type so, if you are
a programmer and you don't touch type, this post is for you.

You have a wonderful opportunity: learn to touch type using an alternative
layout. Why? Because ergonomics, and not speed, matters. Really.

You touch type for a living and you won't suffer from RSI. It is really simple
to get an RSI working full-time as a programmer and it takes a long time to
heal.

You may have heard of guys who have learnt an alternative layout and now they
type on a QWERTY keyboard only at awful speed. You will not have this problem
because you only huck-and-peck and your brain will relate huck-and-peck typing
with QWERTY and touch typing with your choosen keyboard layout. You can retain
your keyboard dexterity.

You don't have to buy another keyboard, nor to relabel yours: keyboard layout
is something for muscles and not for eyes.

There are many alternative layouts out there, all of them is better than QWERTY
and it is not easy to choose.

Why don't you can start by tapping your fingers on the table? It is more easy
for you to "drum" alternating the index finger of each hand, or to roll your
finger of your strongest hand from the pinky to the index? And from the index
to the pinky?

## Do you prefer drums?

If you prefer drums you can try the [Dvorak
layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard):

<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg/900px-KB_United_States_Dvorak.svg.png" alt="Dvorak Simplified Layout" />

You won't find any dvorak cummunity our forums. Dvorak users, I think, keep
secret this little gem. If you want to laugh you can read the
[DvZine](http://www.dvzine.org/).

This layout has all the vowels on the home row of the left hand, on the home
row of the right hand there are the common consonants. This means that, writing
a word, you will drum between the left and the right hands. Finger rolls are
used when a consonant follows another.

Dvorak layout comes pre-installed on all operating systems so you can use it
without downloading anything. You can also try a mod of the Dvorak layout that
made easier to write source code: [the Programmer Dvorak
layout](http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/):

Since in code symbols are frequently used, in this layout they are placed in
the main layer and not in the shift state.

## Do you prefer piano?

If you like to roll your fingers then you may try the following exercise: place
your hand on the home position on the keyboard. This means that the left and
the right index finger must be placed, respectively, on the "F" and on the "J".

Now try to move your left index from the "F" to the "G" and your right index
from the "J" to the "H". Does this movement is comfortable to you? Do you think
that all keys in the home row are born equal, or with exercise they will be?

### With lateral movement

[Colemak](http://colemak.com/) is for you:

Colemak is a well designed alternative by Shai Coleman that is much better of
Dvorak but keeps many keys in the same position of QWERTY. If you use many
shortcuts CUA mode (C-c C-v C-x C-q etc) this is your keyboard layout. Many
people say that Colemak is more easy to learn than Dvorak.

It also has many finger rolls that are particularly pleasant to type.

If you are a Windows user you must download the Colemak layout from its web
site. If you are a Linux or MacOSX user everything comes pre-installed.

Colemak has a wonderful and helpful community that you can find on the
[Colemak web site](http://colemak.com/).

### Without lateral movement

If you find that lateral movement is not for you you may try the [Workman
layout](http://workmanlayout.org/).

This layout builts on the Colemak layout and change other keys from the
QWERTY position to reduce lateral movement (at expence of the other metrics).

If you are a Linux user then, if your X11 server is recent enough, you may
have it pre-installed. If you use Windows or MacOSX then you can download the
layout from (the website)(workman link).

Workman has many finger rolls and its pleasant to type on. You can find a
forum on the (Workman website)(link) where you must talk with other Workman
users.

## Temporary conclusion

Remember that when you have learnt an alternative keyboard layout it is
really simple to rewire your brain to learn another. You can change. You will
change!

Start with a layout and try to type the most common words. Hint: you can find
a list of [english words ordered by
frequency](http://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp). When you have done that
exercise on one layout, take another and try the same thing. When you feel
that a layout is for your hands than try to learn it.

In a following post I will write about the possible learning approaches.

Your quest for your perfect keyboard layout has begun and, if you are like
me, it will never end.
