I&#8217;ve created a fork of this C one-file-only library when it was beerware licensed. You can find it here:

http://github.com/leonardoce/slre

The updated release of this code is GPL licensed and so you can&#8217;t use it in your closed-sourced software if you don&#8217;t contact the author to agree on a different license. You can find the original project site here:
